I have decided to make the Jekyll code and structure that I use, open-source. Feel free to copy the structure, but be sure to change all of the pertinent data so that you appropriately credit the posts I've written, as well as identify your own as such.

You can find the source code for this site at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[jason-c-daniels.net](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/jason-c-daniels.net/)
