That's right. This site's code is hosted on Github, one of the worlds leading cloud-based source code repositories. The site also runs from there.

## Why Github?
That Github serves Jekyll websites was a big selling point. That Jekyll processes more or less standard markdown was an even bigger selling point. That I could get a dirt cheap price on DNS routing through a third party and point it at Github sealed the deal.

## Can I get the source code and content for your site?
Yes. I have decided to make the Jekyll code (templates, css, javascript, typescript...etc.) and folder structure that I use, open-source (MIT License). I am licensing the **content** under a slightly modified: [Creative Commons Required Attribution Non-Commercial No-Derivatives v4.0, International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). 

## What are the modified terms of use/redistribution?
The slight modification is that each of my articles is considered a whole work, attributed to me.

### That means you may:
* Publish your own articles along side mine so long as they are clearly marked as yours.
* Change the overall structure in which the articles reside, so long as the content and attributions of each individual article remains unchanged.

### However, you may not (without my express written permission):
* Make changes of any sort to my content.
* Directly claim nor indirectly imply my endorsement of your use of my content.

## Where can I get the code and content?
You can find the source code and content for this site at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[jason-c-daniels.net](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/jason-c-daniels.net/)

## What do I (Jason) maintain it with?
* *OS*: Linux Mint MATE, as a VirtualBox VM.
* *Editing Software*: Visual Studio Code.
* *Version Control*: SmartGit.
