I'm a disabled software engineer with various interests. One of my favorite interests is Table Top Role Playing Games, (TTRPGs). 
I've enjoyed playing and making maps for settings since I was a young boy of 11 years. (I'm 49 as of writing this.)

I also enjoy, and may or may not post about, cooking, container gardening, my pets (guinea pigs, mice and a gecko), electronics
among others.
