## Synopsis
Ashfallen is a dying world. A cataclysm has corrupted plant life, wildlife and people. Old magics have either ceased to 
work entirely, or take tremendous effort and group participation. For example: healing magic can share wounds, but not
eliminate them entirely.

The cause of the slow death is a tainted magical ash, the fallout from the initial cataclysm. It's been falling for over
one thousand years, slowly but surely killing, warping, and changing everything it touches.

### ???
Life is hard in this setting. Survival is not guaranteed. Magic items are rare. Working magic is simple, and low effect.
Fresh water is either polluted with the ash, or jealously guarded by the settlements that have grown around them. Given
that exposure to the ash can, and usually will, turn people extremely hostile, trust is harder to come by than water.

### Adventure and Campaign Ideas
* _Surviving Attacks by Corrupted Beasts_ : Every manner of beast that could be found in the homeland, can be found in Ushvallen. 
The corruption can not only physically warp a beast, but also drive it to seek out settlements and attack all who live 
within. There are usually signs that precede an attack. This allows parties to plan defense with the hamlet occupants. 
Perhaps each player leads a team in a mutual defense.
* _Learn Purifying Magics_: The Ushvali seem, as individuals, largely uncorrupted by the ashfall. An entrepreneuring 
party could seek to learn why. They would find out that the Ushvali can, with some effort, purify foods, ground, water, 
and, if need be, another living being.
* _Dealing with bandits and raiders_: Hard times call for hard measures. Sometimes this leads people to feed on all but
each other's flesh. Bandits and raiders of all sorts can be found, especially well outside the normally established bounds
of civilization. Some will be corrupted. Others, the bulk of them, will be just lacking morals. But as with everyone, there's
always a motive, so there's often a possibility to negotiate.
* _Reclaiming the homeland_: If the players can learn _and master_ the most potent of the purifying magics, found only in 
ancient Ushvali tomes lost to time (i.e. only to be located in dungeons/ruins) There is a chance they could return to the 
homelands and begin purifying.
* _Find the cause of the continued ashfall_: An astute player will realize that the ash is the product of an _ongoing_ event.
If this event can somehow be stopped, then perhaps life can be restored, everywhere.

## History

### The Discovery of Ushvallen

### The Existential Threat
A powerful and power hungry wizard and devout follower of an evil god had forced his way into the domain of the gods,
and demanded to be made one of them, to be ascended as a minor god of evil. Knowing that gods need worshipers he waged a proxy war against the 
gods by plaguing and attacking their worshippers. A battle commenced within the hall of the gods, the mortal vs the gods,
sparing only his deity.

To combat this threat, the lands of mortals, Fey, and others sent their own teams of heroes to do battle with this wizard.
Ultimately one team survived and found their way into the hall of and confronted the wizard, eventually turning him 
against the god that led him down this path.

Collectively they confronted the now even more powerful deity and destroyed it, nearly ripping the fabric of existence 
apart in the process. An explosion ripped through all of the planes of existence. Shortly thereafter a plume of blue-tinted
ash appeared in the heavens and began falling across all of the known lands.

Everything it touched it tainted. It granted extreme abilities and drove both people and beasts to acts of extreme violence.
Plant life withered at its touch. Regular magic began waning in potency and effect. 

Few magical barriers could stop it. And it was clear that it would eventually taint and destroy everything.

### AF1E: Ashfall and Exodus
The Ushvalar had magic strong enough to mitigate some of the ashfall. Their barriers stopped it from killing or warping 
_all_ plant life. Word of the Ushvali lands having some measure of protection eventually made it back "home" and a mass 
exodus to Ushvallen, often mispronounced Ashfallen, began. 

Over the course of the next decade, 5 million people would board ships destined for the relative
safety of Ushvallen. Only 1 million would arrive safely. Another 15 million would never leave their homelands, succumbing 
to the ash-blight as it became known.

At first the Ushvali people welcomed the exiles. But as their numbers grew and resources dwindled, tensions rose.
Eventually, war broke out.

### AF2E: The Ushvali Wars
Time has lost the true cause of the wars during this period. But one thing is certain: the Ushvali magic was stronger than
anything anyone else had encountered before, or since. Legends tell tales of a single Ushvalar warrior or mage fending off 
striking dead a dozen foes at a time. 

Unfortunately for the Ushvali, their magics were not enough to fend off the newcomers. Their numbers were too few and they 
were not used to war. Some would see the carnage they wrought and stop fighting altogether. Often this meant their own death.

These wars would last 200 years before any lasting peace was found. And with time a little more of the landscape was warped
and corrupted by the trickling of the ashfall, keeping resources limited, and tensions high.

### AF3E: The Present Day
Once the hostilities ceased the Ushvali receded from any further interaction with the exiles turned colonizers. 
They withdrew into their own small hamlets, most foregoing any contact at all with "outsiders" as they would come to call
any non-Ushvali.
